ATOS is a locally hosted, zero-setup application that makes invoicing against backlogs drop-dead simple. It does:

- **Project Management**: Track stories against known backlogs (or use it as an independent PM tool).
- **Invoice Generation**: Generate detailed invoices against those completed stories.
- **Taxes**: Estimate your tax burden for the year using customizable tax files for various regions, whether it be at the national (federal), regional (state), or municipal levels (city).
